    "\n",
    "Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue doing business with a company or service.\\\n",
    "In the telecom industry, churn rates range from 15-25% annually. Churn is critical because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retaining existing customers is less expensive than acquiring new ones.\n",
    "* High churn rates erode market share and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Reduce Churn?** <a id=3></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce customer churn, telecom companies can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict high-risk customers: Identify potential churners using data analytics.\n",
    "* Develop a holistic customer view: Integrate data from various channels (e.g., store visits, purchases, customer service calls, online transactions, social media).\n",
    "* Implement effective retention strategies: Focus on high-risk customers with targeted retention efforts.\n",
    "* Monitor early signs of churn: Track customer interactions and behavior to detect potential churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing churn, telecom companies can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preserve market share\n",
    "* Grow and thrive\n",
    "* Reduce customer acquisition costs\n",
    "* Increase profitability\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, \\\n",
    "including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, tenure, contract type to mention a few.\n",
