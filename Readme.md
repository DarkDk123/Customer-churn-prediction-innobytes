## Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning

<center> <img src="Streamlit_front/images/single_prediction.png" width=50%> </center><br><br>

This project builds a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will **churn (leave)** based on their characteristics. The data comes from a *Telco customer churn* dataset.

### **1. Problem Definition**
>Understanding how customer attributes contribute  the probability of their churn, insights & patterns etc.

> How accurately can we predict customer churn based on customer attributes like usage behavior, contract type, and services used?

### **2. Data**
The dataset is sourced from Telco's customer churn records and includes the following features:

- Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen status)
- Services used (internet, phone, etc.)
- Contract types (month-to-month, one year, two years)
- Billing information (monthly and total charges)

I have used the specific dataset provided in the Internship. For more details explore below sources.

### **3. Evaluation**

We evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. The primary goal is to minimize misclassification errors, **particularly false negatives**.

Also our prime focus was to maximize the **tradeoff** between **Recall & AUC Score.**

### **4. Features**

The dataset contains customer data with various service attributes. Key features include contract type, paperless billing, payment method, monthly charges, and tenure.

After **model driven EDA**, we understand the following features are crucial to predict Customer Churn!

### **5. Key Achievements**

1. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   - Developed a robust preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and encoding features.
   - Efficiently handled missing data and categorical variables.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development**:
   - Built multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
   - Applied cross-validation for model evaluation.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Used Bayesian optimization with `BayesSearchCV` to improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

### **Final Result**

The final model achieved a **recall** of ***90%*** & **AUC score** of ***75%*** , successfully predicting customer churn with good accuracy.
